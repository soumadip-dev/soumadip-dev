### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m [**Soumadip Majila**](https://soumadip.vercel.app), a recent MCA graduate and aspiring Full Stack Developer based in India.

I enjoy learning how things work and building projects from the ground up. Every line of code is a step toward mastering the craft of development.

My current focus is on the MERN stack — MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. I’m also comfortable with tools like Git, Postman, and VS Code.

I’ve worked on several academic and personal projects to strengthen my skills, and my favorite is [Logiqo-PERN](https://github.com/soumadip-dev/Logiqo-PERN). You can check out more of my work in the pinned repositories below.

If you’d like to connect or see more of what I’ve built, feel free to check out my [portfolio](https://soumadip.vercel.app) or explore my GitHub repos.

#### A bit more about me:

* Recently completed my Master's in Computer Applications
* Actively preparing for backend and full-stack developer roles
* Passionate about problem-solving and writing maintainable code
* Hobbies: Coding practice, watching tech tutorials, and exploring new tools
